# LangChain for LLM Application Development

This project is based on the short course **LangChain for LLM Application Development** by DeepLearning.AI, designed to help developers extend the capabilities of language models in real-world applications using the LangChain framework.

## üöÄ Project Overview

In this course-based project, I built foundational knowledge and hands-on experience in constructing applications powered by large language models (LLMs) using LangChain. The course covered a full stack of techniques to build more intelligent, context-aware, and interactive LLM applications.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

- **Models, Prompts, and Parsers**:  
  Learn how to call LLMs, design effective prompts, and parse model responses for downstream tasks.

- **Memories for LLMs**:  
  Use memory modules to store conversational history and manage limited context windows.

- **Chains**:  
  Create sequences of operations that combine prompts, memory, and logic for dynamic workflows.

- **Question Answering over Documents**:  
  Build applications that leverage proprietary documents as a knowledge base for contextual Q&A using LLMs.

- **Agents**:  
  Explore LangChain's agent framework that enables LLMs to make decisions and perform complex reasoning with tools.

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies

- LangChain
- OpenAI API
- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks

## üí° Key Takeaways

- Applied LLMs beyond simple prompt/response scenarios.
- Integrated memory and chains to create multi-turn conversations.
- Implemented a Q&A system over custom documents using vector stores.
- Developed agent-based workflows where LLMs reason about next steps and invoke tools.
